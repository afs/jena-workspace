== Generate


alias keyt=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/keytool
  Java12+ has a different algorithm

keyt -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias localhost -keystore localhost-test.jks -storepass "store-pw" -validity 20000 -keysize 2048



Then 
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  localhost
then nothing.
Is CN=localhost, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown correct?
  [no]:  yes

	for: CN=localhost, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown

== List
