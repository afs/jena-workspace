    <section name="Jakarta ORO">

      <p>
      The Jakarta-ORO Java classes are a set of text-processing Java
      classes that provide Perl5 compatible regular expressions,
      AWK-like regular expressions, glob expressions, and utility
      classes for performing substitutions, splits, filtering
      filenames, etc.  This library is the successor to the
      OROMatcher, AwkTools, PerlTools, and TextTools libraries from
      ORO, Inc. (www.oroinc.com).  They have been donated to the
      Jakarta Project by Daniel Savarese (www.savarese.org), the
      copyright holder of the ORO libraries.  Daniel will continue to
      participate in their development under the Jakarta Project.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Jakarta Project is lucky to also be able to offer another
      regexp <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/">solution</a>
      for you as well as this package.  Options are a good thing and we
      will leave which one you choose to use up to you. :-)  They are
      both perfectly good packages, we just consider the Jakarta ORO
      package to be more a more complete regular expression package.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can download the latest released version from the
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi">
      distribution</a> directory.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Javadoc is <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/">
      available online</a>. It is also included in the distribution download.
      </p>

      <p>

      or another (Mailing lists, CVS, Contributions), please see the
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/getinvolved/getinvolvedindex.html">
