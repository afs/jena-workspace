o Optimize/improve Unicode character classes.

o Fix any pending bugs listed in BUGS file.

o Update org.apache.oro.text.regex and org.apache.oro.text.perl syntax to 
  latest version of Perl, currently version 5.6.  This will require
  a lot of work.

o Pattern cache implementations are probably not very efficient.
  Should revisit and reimplement. 

o Look for ways to avoid creating unnecessary String instances and
  potential cases of redundant String/char[] conversions.

o The MatchAction, MatchActionInfo, and MatchActionProcessor classes
  were just a bad idea because that sort of thing is very inefficient
  in Java.  The class should probably be removed.

o Reduce the memory overhead of case insensitive matching in Perl5Matcher.

o Measure performance of HotSpot iterating through match input via
  an interface's virtual function versus direct character array indexing.
  If HotSpot dynamically inlines the functions and achieves comparable
  performance, provided a clear warning is indicated that performance
  could be reduced on earlier JDK versions, could create a generic interface
  for representing input. Input array indexing could be replaced with
  the generic interface, PatternMatcherInput could be made to implement
  the interface, and stream matching could be reintroduced.
  Reintroduced stream matching could include a callback mechanism in the
  interface to report when a "contains" match has been found to allow
  the input encapsulator to trim its buffer.  Strong warnings must go
  into the documentation referencing the ACM paper and noting that for
  many streams it will be more efficient to read the entire stream into
  a buffer first rather than try to match incrementally because many
  regular expressions will cause the whole stream to be read in anyway.
  For situations where that is not the case we want to be able to trim
  the buffer (there have been people who used OROMatcher to search
  gigabyte length files!).  Additional methods could be added to
  regulate buffer growth behavior, whether to save all of it for reuse
  in a future pass, etc.
  
o Make separate src and bin distributions.  Current distribution is
  getting big on account of 1.2 MB of API docs.  src only distribution
  should be half the size of bin distribution for quicker download.
