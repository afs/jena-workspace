The Jakarta-ORO library contains packages for performing general text
processing in Java, with an aim to support, though not specifically
limited to, servlet development.  The core package is
{@link org.apache.oro.text.regex}, which defines abstract interfaces for
manipulating regular expressions, as well as a set of Perl5 comptabile
regular expression classes.  Developers will mostly be interested only
in that package.
