<h1>Jakarta ORO</h1>

<p>
The Jakarta-ORO Java classes are a set of text-processing Java classes
that provide Perl5 compatible regular expressions, AWK-like regular
expressions, glob expressions, and utility classes for performing
substitutions, splits, filtering filenames, etc.  This library is
the successor to the OROMatcher, AwkTools, PerlTools, and TextTools
libraries from ORO, Inc. (www.oroinc.com).  They have been donated to
the Jakarta Project by Daniel Savarese (www.savarese.org), the
copyright holder of the ORO libraries.  Daniel will continue to
participate in their development under the Jakarta Project.
</p>

<p>
The Jakarta Project is lucky to also be able to offer another more "lightweight" 
regexp <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/">solution</a> for you as well 
as this package. Options are a good thing and we will leave which one you choose 
to use up to you. :-) They are both perfectly good packages, we just consider
the Jakarta ORO package to be more a more complete regular expression package.
</p>

An online <a

expression?&quot;, &quot;Why did you do this? There are already other Java
regexp packages available!&quot;, etc.
