o Optimize/improve Unicode character classes.

o Fix any pending bugs listed in BUGS file.

o Update org.apache.oro.text.regex and org.apache.oro.text.perl syntax to 
  latest version of Perl, currently version 5.6.  This will require
  a lot of work.

o Pattern cache implementations are probably not very efficient.
  Should revisit and reimplement. 

o Look for ways to avoid creating unnecessary String instances and
  potential cases of redundant String/char[] conversions.

o The MatchAction, MatchActionInfo, and MatchActionProcessor classes
  were just a bad idea because that sort of thing is very inefficient
  in Java.  The class should probably be removed.

o Reduce the memory overhead of case insensitive matching in Perl5Matcher.
