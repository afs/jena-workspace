Version 2.0.2-dev-2

o Applied a modified version of Takashi Okamoto's unicode/posix patch.
  It adds unicode support to character classes and adds partial support
  for posix classes (it supports things like [:digit:] and [:print:], but
  not [:^digit:] and [:^print:]).  It will be improved/optimized later, but
  gives people the functionality they need today.

Version 2.0.2-dev-1

o Removed commented out code and changed OpCode._isWordCharacter() to
  use Character.isLetterOrDigit()

o Some documentation fixes.

o Perl5Matcher was not properly tracking the current offset in
  __interpret so PatternMatcherInput would not have its current offset
  properly updated.  This bug was introduced when fixing the
  PatternMatcherInput anchor bug.  When the currentOffset parameter
  was added to __interpret, not all of the necessary
  __currentOffset = beginOffset assignments were changed to
  __currentOffset = currentOffset assignments.  This has been
  fixed by updating the remaining assignments.

o The org.apache.oro.text.regex.Util.split() method was further 
  generalized to accept a Collection reference argument to store the result.

Version 2.0.1

o Jeff ? (jlb@houseofdistraction.com) and Peter Kronenberg
  (pkronenberg@predictivetechnologies.com) identified a bug in the
   behavior of PatternMatcherInput matching methods with respect to
   anchors (^).  Matches were always being performed interpreting the
   beginning of the string from either a 0 or a current offset rather
   than from the beginOffset.  Essentially, the beginning of the string
   for purposes of matching ^ wasn't being associated with beginOffset.
  This problem has been fixed.

o A problem with multiline matches that was introduced in the
  transition from OROMatcher/Perltools/etc. to Jakarta-ORO
  was fixed.

o The org.apache.oro.text.regex.Util.split() method was generalized to 
  accept a List reference argument to store the result.

Version 2.0

Many small, but important, changes have been made to this software
between its last release as ORO software and its first release as part
of the Apache Jakarta project.  The last versions of the ORO software
were:
	OROMatcher 1.1 (com.oroinc.text.regex)
	PerlTools  1.2 (com.oroinc.text.perl)
	AwkTools   1.0 (com.oroinc.text.awk)
	TextTools  1.1 (com.oroinc.io, com.oroinc.text, com.oroinc.util)

OROMatcher 1.1 was fully compatible with Perl 5.003 regular expressions.
Many changes have been made to the regular expression behavior in
successive versions of Perl.  The goal is to update org.apache.oro.text.regex
to the latest version of Perl (5.6 at this time), but only some of this
work has been done.

o Guaranteed compatibility with JDK 1.1 is discontinued.  JDK 1.2 features
  may be used indiscriminately, even though they may not have been used
  at this time.

o Perl5StreamInput and methods manipulating Perl5StreamInput have been
  removed.  For the technical reasons behind this decision see
  "On the Use of Regular Expressions for Searching Text", Clark and Cormack,
  ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol 19, No. 3,
  pp 413-426.

o Default behavior of '^' and '$' as matched by Perl5Matcher has
  changed to match as though in single line mode, which appears to be
  the Perl default.  Previously if you did not specify single line or
  multi-line mode, '^' and '$'  would act as though in multi-line mode.
  Now they act as though in single line mode, unless you specify otherwise
  with setMultiline() or by compiling the expression with an appropriate mask.
  However, '.' acts as in multi-line mode by default and its behavior
  can only be altered by compiling an expression with SINGLELINE_MASK.
  setMultiline() emulates the Perl $* variable, whereas the MASK variables
  emulate the ismx modifiers.

o All deprecated methods have been removed.  This includes various
  substitute() convenience methods from com.oroinc.text.regex.Util

o Javadoc comments have been updated to use 1.2 standard doclet features.
