      <p>
      The Jakarta-ORO Java classes are a set of text-processing Java
      classes that provide Perl5 compatible regular expressions,
      AWK-like regular expressions, glob expressions, and utility
      classes for performing substitutions, splits, filtering
      filenames, etc.  This library is the successor to the
      OROMatcher, AwkTools, PerlTools, and TextTools libraries originally
      from ORO, Inc.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can download the latest released version from the
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi">
      distribution</a> directory.

      The Javadoc is <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/">
