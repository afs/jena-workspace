    <section name="Bug Reporting Guidelines">

      <p>
      Before you decide to report a bug, make sure you have adequately
      verified that it is not a problem in your code.  For example, if
      you are using the org.apache.oro.text.regex or
      org.apache.oro.text.perl packages, double check your results
      against Perl.  Right now, compatibility is only guaranteed with
      Perl 5.003_07.  Eventually we will guarantee Perl 5.6
      compatibility.  It may be that what you think is a problem is
      just a difference in behavior between Perl 5.003_07 and 5.6.  In
      that case pester the oro-dev mailing list to get on the case and
      move faster toward 5.6 compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
      Before reporting any bug, inquire on either the oro-user or
      oro-dev <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">
      mailing lists.</a>  You will get a faster response.  Always
      include sample code and input that reproduces your problem and
      indicate what version of jakarta-oro you are using.  If you are
      not using the latest stable release, download the latest release
      and see if the problem is still there before submitting a
      report.  If we cannot reproduce a problem, we can't help.
      </p>
      <p>
      If after you've followed the guidelines above, it is either
      confirmed or at least not refuted that your problem is caused by
      a bug in jakarta-oro, you may submit a bug report through
      <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a>
