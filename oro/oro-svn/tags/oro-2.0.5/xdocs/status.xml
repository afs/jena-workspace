      <p>
      Version 2.0.5 is the latest release.  It currently supports Perl
      5.003 regular expressions in the org.apache.oro.text.regex and
      org.apache.oro.text.perlpackages.  The main development goal is
      to upgrade these packages to support Perl 5.6 regular
      expressions.  The development plan will lay out the path to
      achieving this objective and this status page will report the
      state of our progress.  Our current objective is to settle on a
      development plan sometime in the near future.
